        <h1 class="secH">What is Pterygium?</h1>
        <p class="bigtextPara">Pterygium, commonly referred to as “surfer’s eye,” is a non-cancerous, wing-shaped growth of tissue on the white part of the eye (sclera) that can extend onto the cornea. It usually forms on the side closest to the nose and may grow slowly over time. While mild cases may not cause symptoms, larger or advanced pterygia can distort vision, cause irritation, redness, and affect the appearance of the eye.</p>
        <p class="bigtextPara">The condition is strongly linked to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, wind, dust, and dry environments—making it more common in people who spend a lot of time outdoors without eye protection. Though it is not harmful in the early stages, untreated pterygium can lead to vision issues or recurring inflammation. In more severe cases, surgical removal is recommended to restore clear vision and eye comfort.</p>

      <h2 class="secH">Common Symptoms of Pterygium</h2>
      <p class="bigtextPara">Pterygium may start without noticeable symptoms, but as it progresses, patients may experience various discomforts, including:</p>
      <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
        <li>Redness and eye irritation</li>
        <li>A visible fleshy growth on the white of the eye</li>
        <li>Foreign body sensation or gritty feeling</li>
        <li>Dryness and increased tearing</li>
        <li>Blurred vision (if the growth encroaches on the cornea)</li>
        <li>Itchiness or mild burning sensation</li>
        <li>Cosmetic concerns due to visible tissue on the eye</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These symptoms may worsen with sun exposure, wind, smoke, or air pollution. Regular monitoring is essential to detect progression, especially if the pterygium begins affecting the cornea or altering vision. Artificial tears and protective eyewear can help manage mild symptoms before surgical intervention is needed.</p>

   <h2 class="secH text-center">Types of Pterygium</h2>
   <p class="maxPara">Though all pterygia share a similar appearance, they are generally classified based on their severity and stage of progression:</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
        <div class="diseasesTypesCards">

            <h3 class="fourthH">Atrophic (Inactive) Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Atrophic pterygium is a thin, flat growth on the white part of the eye, often pale with minimal blood vessels. It usually remains stable, causes no vision problems, and may not require treatment. Symptoms, if present, are mild—like dryness or irritation. Though it doesn’t grow actively, regular monitoring is recommended, especially for people frequently exposed to sun, wind, or dust. Artificial tears and sunglasses can help manage minor discomfort and prevent worsening.</p>

          <div class="typesInfo">
            <h3 class="fourthH">Progressive (Active) Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Progressive pterygium is a thick, red, and inflamed tissue that actively grows from the conjunctiva toward the cornea. It can cause irritation, a foreign body sensation, and blurred vision if it encroaches on the visual axis. This type may worsen rapidly due to UV exposure or dry conditions. Early treatment with lubricants, anti-inflammatory drops, and lifestyle adjustments may help slow progression. In advanced cases, surgery may be necessary to prevent corneal distortion and permanent vision problems.</p>

            <h3 class="fourthH">Recurrent Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Recurrent pterygium refers to regrowth of the tissue after surgical removal. It often appears more aggressive than the original and may grow faster with more inflammation and scarring. Symptoms typically include redness, discomfort, and visual disturbance. Risk of recurrence is higher in younger patients and in areas with high UV exposure. Close postoperative monitoring and proper surgical technique using conjunctival grafts or anti-scarring agents can reduce recurrence rates and improve long-term outcomes.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Risk Factors for Pterygium</h2>
          <p>Several environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the development of pterygium. These include:</p>
           <ul class="UlStyle mb-4">
            <li><strong>Chronic UV light exposure: </strong> The most significant risk, especially in tropical or sunny regions with strong sunlight.</li>
            <li><strong>Dust, wind, and air pollution: </strong> Irritate the ocular surface, increasing inflammation and pterygium formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry eye or chronic eye irritation: </strong> Reduced tear film makes the eye more vulnerable to external damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Occupational exposure: </strong> Outdoor workers, such as farmers, construction laborers, fishermen, or surfers, are particularly vulnerable.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic location: </strong> Higher incidence is seen in people living closer to the equator.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics: </strong> A family history of pterygium may slightly increase susceptibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of eye protection: </strong> Individuals not wearing sunglasses or protective gear are at greater risk.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Wearing UV-blocking sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and using lubricating eye drops are essential preventive strategies for those at risk.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Diagnosis & Treatment of Pterygium</h2>
          <h3 class="fourthH">Diagnosis:</h3>
          <p>Pterygium is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye examination, including:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Visual acuity test to assess if vision is affected</li>
            <li>Slit-lamp examination for detailed evaluation of the growth</li>
            <li>Corneal topography in advanced cases to assess corneal shape and astigmatism</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="fourthH mt-4">Treatment:</h3>
          <ul class="UlStyle mb-4">
            <li><strong>Mild Cases: </strong> Managed with lubricating eye drops or anti-inflammatory medications to relieve redness and discomfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Severe or Progressive Cases: </strong> Surgical removal is advised if the pterygium is growing toward the central cornea or causing visual distortion.</li>
            <li><strong>Surgical method: </strong> Excision with conjunctival autograft reduces recurrence risk. Sometimes, amniotic membrane grafts are used.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Recovery is usually smooth, but close follow-up is necessary to monitor healing and detect regrowth.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="riskFactorcard">
          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Post-Surgery Care Tips</h2>
          <p>Post-operative care following pterygium surgery is crucial for preventing complications and ensuring proper healing. Key guidelines include:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Use prescribed antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops regularly</li>
            <li>Avoid rubbing or touching the operated eye</li>
            <li>Wear protective sunglasses outdoors to shield from UV light </li>
            <li>Limit exposure to dust, wind, and smoke during healing</li>
            <li>Refrain from swimming, heavy lifting, or strenuous activity for at least 1 week</li>
            <li>Attend scheduled follow-up visits to monitor for recurrence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mild redness, discomfort, or tearing is normal during the first few days. Most patients resume normal activities within a week, but full recovery may take several weeks. Strict hygiene and follow-up help reduce the chances of regrowth, especially in high-risk individuals.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Prevention Tips for Pterygium</h2>
          <p>While not always avoidable, the development and progression of pterygium can often be prevented or minimized with the following measures:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Wear wraparound sunglasses with 100% UV protection when outdoors</li>
            <li>Use lubricating eye drops to keep the eyes moist and reduce irritation</li>
            <li>Avoid direct exposure to dusty, dry, or windy environments</li>
            <li>Wear protective eyewear if your job involves outdoor work or exposure to irritants</li>
            <li>Maintain good eye hygiene and avoid excessive eye rubbing</li>
            <li>Schedule regular eye check-ups, especially if you live in high-risk areas</li>
            <li>Drink adequate water and consume omega-3-rich foods to support eye health</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These practices are especially important for individuals with a history of pterygium or those at high risk of recurrence.</p>
