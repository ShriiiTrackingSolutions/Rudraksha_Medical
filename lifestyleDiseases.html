        <h1 class="secH">What are Lifestyle Diseases?</h1>
        <p class="bigtextPara">Lifestyle diseases are chronic, non-communicable health conditions that arise primarily due to unhealthy habits and environmental factors. Unlike infectious diseases, these conditions develop gradually and are strongly influenced by the way people live — including their diet, physical activity, sleep, stress levels, and substance use. Common lifestyle diseases include Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, chronic respiratory issues, and certain types of cancer. These diseases are among the leading causes of death globally but are largely preventable through long-term behavioral changes and health awareness. They often go unnoticed in the early stages, making regular health check-ups essential. Addressing lifestyle diseases requires a holistic approach involving medical support, personal responsibility, and community-level health initiatives.</p>

          <li><strong>Certain Cancers: </strong> Including colon, breast, and lung cancers, influenced by poor lifestyle habits.</li>
          <li><strong>Mental Health Disorders: </strong> Like depression and anxiety, often aggravated by modern lifestyle stressors.</li>

    </div>
     <div class="col-lg-6">
