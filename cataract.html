        <h1 class="secH">What is Cataract?</h1>
        <p class="bigtextPara">A cataract is a common eye condition where the clear lens inside the eye becomes cloudy or opaque, leading to blurry, dull, or distorted vision. This clouding occurs due to the breakdown of proteins in the lens, usually as a result of aging. However, cataracts can also be caused by eye injuries, long-term use of steroid medications, diabetes, or prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In the early stages, cataracts may not noticeably affect vision, but as they progress, they can interfere with daily activities such as reading, driving, or recognizing faces. Cataracts typically develop in both eyes but not always at the same rate. If left untreated, they can lead to significant vision loss. Fortunately, cataracts can be effectively treated through a simple surgical procedure that replaces the cloudy lens with a clear artificial one, restoring clear vision.</p>

   <h2 class="secH text-center">Types of Cataracts</h2>
   <p class="maxPara">There are several types of cataracts, classified by their location in the lens or the cause of formation</p>
   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="diseasesTypesCards">

            <h3 class="fourthH">Nuclear Cataract</h3>
            <p>A nuclear cataract forms in the central (nuclear) zone of the lens and is the most common type associated with aging. Over time, the center of the lens gradually hardens, turns yellow or brown, and causes blurry or dim vision. In some cases, it may initially improve near vision — a phenomenon known as "second sight" — but this is temporary. As the cataract advances, distance vision becomes increasingly impaired. It can also cause difficulty distinguishing colors and seeing in low light or bright sunlight due to increased light scatter.</p>

          <div class="typesInfo">
            <h3 class="fourthH">Cortical Cataract</h3>
            <p>Cortical cataracts start at the edges (cortex) of the lens and gradually extend toward the center in a spoke-like pattern. These cataracts disrupt how light enters the eye and may cause glare, halos, and decreased contrast sensitivity, especially when driving at night or in bright conditions. They can also affect depth perception and clarity of vision in varying lighting environments. This type is more commonly seen in people with diabetes or those exposed to excessive sunlight and tends to progress at a moderate pace, eventually interfering with both near and distance vision if left untreated.</p>

            <h3 class="fourthH">Posterior Subcapsular Cataract</h3>
            <p>Posterior subcapsular cataracts develop at the back of the lens, just in front of the capsule that holds the lens in place. This type tends to progress more quickly than other cataracts and significantly affects near vision. Patients often notice difficulty reading, increased sensitivity to bright lights, and glare or halos around lights — especially in sunlight or while driving at night. It is more common in younger individuals, those taking corticosteroids, or people with diabetes. Due to its location, it interferes directly with the path of light to the retina, causing visual disturbances even in early stages.</p>

            <h3 class="fourthH">Congenital Cataract</h3>
            <p>Congenital cataracts are present at birth or develop during infancy or early childhood. They may occur in one or both eyes and can be inherited genetically or result from infections (like rubella or chickenpox during pregnancy), metabolic disorders, or trauma. Some congenital cataracts are small and do not affect vision, while others may require early surgical removal to prevent vision development issues such as amblyopia (lazy eye). Timely detection through routine pediatric eye screening is essential for preserving and improving long-term visual outcomes in children with this condition.</p>

          <p>Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing cataracts:</p>
          <ul class="UlStyle">
            <li><strong>Aging: </strong> The leading cause, especially in individuals over 60.</li>
            <li><strong>Diabetes: </strong>  High blood sugar levels can accelerate lens clouding.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive UV Exposure: </strong> Sunlight damages the eye lens over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoking & Alcohol: </strong> Both are linked to increased cataract risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Family History: </strong> Genetics may predispose individuals to early cataracts.</li>
            <li><strong>Eye Injuries or Surgery: </strong> Trauma or previous surgery can trigger lens damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Prolonged Steroid Use: </strong> Medications such as corticosteroids may induce cataract formation.</li>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Cataract Diagnosis & Treatment</h2>
          <p>A cataract is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam that includes:</p>
          <ul class="UlStyle">
            <li><strong>Visual Acuity Test: </strong> Checks clarity of vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Slit-Lamp Examination: </strong> Allows detailed inspection of the lens.</li>
            <li><strong>Retinal Exam: </strong> Detects changes in the back of the eye.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="thirdH mt-4">Treatment: </h3>
          <p>Mild cataracts may be managed with glasses, brighter lighting, or magnifying lenses. However, the only permanent treatment is cataract surgery, where the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). It is a safe, outpatient procedure with a very high success rate and a quick recovery timeline.</p>

          <p>Cataract surgery recovery is generally smooth, but following post-operative care instructions ensures optimal healing:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Use prescribed antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops as directed.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching or rubbing the eye.</li>
            <li>Wear protective eyewear or shields, especially while sleeping.</li>
            <li>Refrain from strenuous activities, heavy lifting, or bending over.</li>
            <li>Do not swim or expose your eyes to dust and bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>Attend all follow-up visits for vision monitoring.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Following these tips helps reduce infection risk and promotes faster visual recovery.</p>

          <p>While cataracts cannot always be prevented, certain lifestyle choices may delay their development:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Wear UV-protection sunglasses when outdoors.</li>
            <li>Eat a diet rich in antioxidants, including leafy greens, carrots, and citrus fruits.</li>
            <li>Quit smoking and limit alcohol intake.</li>
            <li>Control underlying health issues like diabetes and hypertension.</li>
            <li>Avoid prolonged use of steroid medications unless medically advised.</li>
            <li>Schedule regular comprehensive eye exams, especially after age 40.</li>
            <li>Use protective eyewear to avoid eye injuries.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Being proactive about eye health is key to preserving clear vision throughout life.</p>
